# Conway's Game of Life
This is a **TypeScript** implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

I decided to take on this project to dive into TypeScript and boy, did it pay off! I learned so much about TypeScript's syntax, type system, and all the awesome things it can do. It really leveled up my TypeScript skills and made me a better problem-solver as a programmer.

[Here](https://ssaturgo.github.io/game-of-life/) is a link to preview the project. Feel free to check it out and see the Game of Life in action!

## What is this?
Now, let me tell you a bit about Conway's Game of Life. It's this fascinating cellular automaton created by the brilliant mathematician John Horton Conway back in 1970. It's a game that doesn't require any player input once it starts. The evolution of the game is solely determined by its initial state.

The game's rules determine whether a cell lives, dies, or is born in the next generation. It's like a little ecosystem right there on your screen!

**Here's how the game works**
```
1. If a cell has less than two neighbors, it's like being all alone and it dies of loneliness.
2. If a cell has two or three neighbors, it's living its best life and survives to the next generation.
3. If a cell has more than three neighbors, it's like having too many friends and it can't handle the pressure, so it dies.
4. If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors, it's like getting a second chance at life and becomes alive again.
```

These rules determine the fate of the cells in the game. Will they live, die, or be reborn in the next generation?

## Technology Used
This project is implemented using the following technologies:

**- TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. <br>
**- HTML:** The standard markup language for creating web pages.<br>
**- CSS:** The language used for styling web pages.<br>


I made a conscious effort to avoid using any frameworks since I am still in the learning phase. Once I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals, I may consider exploring and learning a framework.
